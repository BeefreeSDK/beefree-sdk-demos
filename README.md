The Beefree SDK team created this demo code during the Saved Rows live coding session. The React app was created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and uses the [Beefree SDK Official NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mailupinc/bee-plugin). This code demonstrates a functional saved rows implementation with edit and delete management, including using content dialog.
